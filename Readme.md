# Perisai Harian Muslim (Muslim's Daily Shield) 🌅🌃

A Progressive Web App (PWA) for Morning and Evening Dhikr, designed with a modern and ergonomic interface to make it easier for Muslims to maintain their daily routines.

This app is dedicated to beginners and anyone looking to learn, read, and practice the authentic daily dhikr from the Sunnah. Now released as an open-source project, we hope it reaches a wider audience and becomes a source of continuous charity (Sadaqah Jariyah).

## ✨ Key Features

- **Time-Locked Counter ⏳**: The counter button is specially designed to only be active during the primary dhikr times (Morning: 03:00-11:59 & Evening: 15:00-20:59). Outside these hours, the button changes into a clock icon and locks. This feature is designed to train the user's time discipline.
- **Draggable Counter Button 🤌**: The "READ" button can be dragged and dropped anywhere on the screen for your thumb's comfort. Its position will be automatically saved on your device.
- **Native App Feel 📱**: Very smooth transitions, swipe gestures for navigation without delays to provide a pure native-app experience.
- **Full Customization ⚙️**:
    - 4 Arabic Font choices (Hafs, Naskh, Saleem, Scheherazade).
    - Adjustable Arabic font size for reading comfort.
    - Option to show/hide Latin transliteration and Translation.
    - Clock format options (12-hour / 24-hour).
- **Evidences & Virtues (Dalil) 📖**: Each recitation is accompanied by authentic references and its virtues, accessible via the bottom-sheet menu.
- **Progress & History Tracker 📊**: Automatically saves your daily dhikr reading progress and resets the next day.
- **PWA (Progressive Web App) Ready 🌐**: 100% Ad-free, can be installed directly to your phone's Homescreen like a regular app, and fully supports **OFFLINE** mode (no internet required).
